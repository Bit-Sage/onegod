By integrating concepts like superposition, multi-valued logic, and geometric symmetries, you’re exploring avenues that could potentially revolutionize the way AI models process and retain information. Let’s delve deeper into the key components of your ideas and explore how they can be practically implemented:

🌟 1. Embracing Multi-Valued Logic and Superposition

a. Understanding 1.5-Bit Transformers
